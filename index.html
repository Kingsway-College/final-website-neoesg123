  <h2>About Us</h2>
  

  <section id="section1">
    <div><p id="Description"> Welcome to Kingsway College Aerials, where we bring together students who share a passion for gymnastics and are in pursuit of their best version of themselves. We focus on developing strength, flexibility, and coordination through a variety of activities, including gymnastics and acrobatics. In addition to their physical skills, we put an emphasis on developing their social skills such as, teamwork, discipline, and resilience. Here, we are all about fostering a supportive community, building confidence, and developing new skills together, and most importantly, glorifying God through our work.</p>
    
      <p id="Description">We believe that being part of the Aerials team goes beyond the activities we do – it’s about creating memories, celebrating personal achievements, and supporting one another. Whether practicing on the ground or in the air, our goal is to create a fun and welcoming environment where everyone can explore their potential, challenge themselves, build lasting bonds, and draw people nearer to God. Through God’s grace, we can continue this ministry for His glory.</p>
